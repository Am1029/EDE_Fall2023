## OVERVIEW

This exercise accompanies the introductory material in Environmental Data Analytics. 

## Directions
1.  Rename this file `<FirstLast>_A01_Introduction.Rmd` (replacing `<FirstLast>` with your first and last name).
2.  Change "Student Name" on line 3 (above) with your name.
3.  Work through the steps, **creating code and output** that fulfill each instruction.
4.  Be sure to **answer the questions** in this assignment document.
5.  When you have completed the assignment, **Knit** the text and code into a single PDF file.
6.  After Knitting, submit the completed exercise (PDF file) to the appropriate assigment section on Sakai.


## 1) Finish setting up R Studio

### Install TinyTex
Now, run this code cell the same way. This will install "tinytex" -- a helper app that allows you to knit your markdown documents into professional quality PDFs.
```{r install tiny tex, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
#install tinytext
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

### Set your default knit directory
This setting will help deal with relative paths later on...
 - From the Tool menu, select `Global Options`
 - Select the RMarkdown section
 - In the "Evaluate chunks in directory", set the option to "Project" (If you don't see this option, try restarting RStudio.)


## 2) Discussion Questions
Enter answers to the questions just below the >Answer: prompt.

1. What are your previous experiences with data analytics, R, and Git? Include both formal and informal training.

> Answer: Frst time when i was introduce to R was in 2019 while i was studying in Poland. It was a very shallow introduction to the program and i used it for one or two assignments in a class. With Git i haven't had previous experiences. 

2. Are there any components of the course about which you feel confident?

> Answer: The course presents pretty much a very new knowledge to me and for now i can be confident only to myself and my end-goal of learning this language. 

3. Are there any components of the course about which you feel apprehensive?

> Answer: While installing the program/s and preparing the working space, a lot of the comands and terminology are very new and unfamiliar to me. Positively thinking, i guess once we set up the working space, there won't be much work on that side. If yes, please let us know to review the videos and try to undestand the connection and the terminology used while setting up the program/s. 


## 3) GitHub

Provide a link below to your forked course repository in GitHub. Make sure you have pulled all recent changes from the course repository and that you have updated your course README file, committed those changes, and pushed them to your GitHub account.
